Tic-Tac-Toe
===========

Uh, in a recent drive to become better acquainted with both Python and Pygame
I've decided to make a new trivial video game each week. I've started with
Tic-Tac-Toe because the mechanics are pretty simple both in terms of the
AI required and the graphics.

Graphics aren't really my strong-point, as you can probably tell from the
stuff in the resources folder.
